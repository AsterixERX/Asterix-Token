# Asterix-Token
What is Asterix?
 
Asterix is a peer-to-peer token built on the binance smart chain to support our ecosystem of Dapps. The main aim of choosing Binance as the primary blockchain is to improve scalability and faster transaction along with low transaction fees and we are also working on our new blockchain to step up the game to provide you with the lowest or the negligible transaction fee. 
 
 
Why Asterix?
 
The Asterix network is aiming to solve the biggest problem of “centralization” not only in the financial sector but in most of the sectors which consumes time and money but we are here to solve that problem by “Asterix Hash”, a technology patented by us to bring existing consumer technologies into the blockchain which eventually improves scalability and the time taken to do a certain task drastically than the traditional system. We are planning to build an interconnected ecosystem that will help you to use our token in every sector possible, doesn’t that sound like replacing the fiat currency? The simple answer to that question is “yes to some extent”.

We have a dedicated team of developers as well as designers to keep researching the possible ways of connecting the real world into the blockchain (A R&D in short), we believe in the possibility of a decentralized world.

Ecosystem
 
As a utility token, we mainly focus on expanding blockchain and its use cases. The blockchain is a vast ocean and we believe it can help major sectors due to its decentralized and transparent nature.
Our main focus while expanding it to major sectors include,
 
Maximizing user experience with a reduction in operating cost as well as the users availing at a discounted cost and all this will be way faster than the traditional method.
 
Researching the depths of unexplored blockchain and experimenting with different applications of blockchain, helping the growth of consumer technology
 
Goals:
 
- We are focusing on building a blockchain company that will license its services as in a 7:3 royalty model so that we could make blockchain available for all and thus making it as usable as the internet so that every company could build their own ecosystem thus improving maximizing user experience
 
- We will set up first ‘research and development’ in the blockchain sector in India with a country’s passionate developers to experiment with blockchain in different sectors as well as the possibility of “Integrating blockchain with artificial intelligence”
 
- Developing Daaps on the blockchain with the non-tech savvy community in mind bringing the technology closer to the mass
 
- In the next 10 years, we are planning to integrate different countries on a distributed blockchain starting from our base country India which has a population of 1.38 billion people.
 
Use cases:
 
- Automatic money lending platform: An automatic money lending platform without any collateral using a flash loan system on the BSC chain which we will be releasing soon as an independent token to avoid any sudden price fluctuation in our native token.
A patented technology “Asterix Hash” will use RFID tags with Javascript on one end and blockchain and smart contract on another end to open millions of possibilities into an “Interaction less” payment module. Read more 
 
- Global Credit Scoring: A universal credit scoring system that allows an individual’s credit score to be accessed globally which could help that individual to avail of loan services provided by any financial institution globally.
 
- Digital Identification system: A KYC approach that can be used by institutions or a decentralized identity verification system which will enable an individual’s identity to be global 
 
- An NFT marketplace for game collectibles will enable players to earn collectible tokens which can be sold in the NFT marketplace.
 
- A cross-platform “Asterix wallet” to enable and ease international and national transactions across wallets in different blockchains with built-in functions to enable cross-platform bridge swap

Risks of trading:
 
The risks of trading cryptocurrencies are mainly related to their volatility. They are high-risk and speculative, and it is important that you understand the risks before you start trading.
 
They are volatile: unexpected changes in market sentiment can lead to sharp and sudden moves in price. It is not uncommon for the value of cryptocurrencies to quickly drop by hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.
 
They are unregulated: cryptocurrencies are currently unregulated by both governments and central banks. However, recently they have started to attract more attention. For example, there are questions about whether to classify them as a commodity or a virtual currency
